# Find n'walk

A mobile app that helps users find good places for praticing physical activities in their city, like a calm street that's great for biking or a lesser known hiking trail. It also allows them to arrange meetings in those locations with other users, so that they can have partners in collective sports. Or at least, that's what it will be once we've finished it, hopefully within the term :)

Since we're developing it for our thesis, we won't be accepting any contributions, but it _is_ free software. If you like the idea and want to develop it further, please feel free to fork it.
