# Find n'walk

A mobile app that helps users find good places for praticing physical activities in their city, like a calm street that's great for biking or a lesser known hiking trail. Or at least, that's what it will be once we've finished it, hopefully within the term :)

Since we're developing it for our thesis, we won't be accepting any contributions, but it _is_ [free software](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software "Info about free software"). If you like the idea and want to develop it further, please feel free to fork it.
